# Annotated Call Graph (ACG)

Application developers can use MeshInsight to estimate service mesh overhead in any deployment scenario of interest by providing an annotated call graph (ACG). See section 4.2 of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00592.pdf) for ACG definition. Here, we show the encoding format of ACG that MeshInsight expects.
